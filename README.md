This repo is a place for me to accumulate my devops learnings


# What is devops according to me ?
DevOps is a combination of organizational culture, process and tools that enable us to deliver the application continuously and smoothly at a faster pace.

In initial stages of my career when I first heard the term DevOps, I was of the opinion that its all about automating the manual process involved in deploying the application to any environment. And I have met other people who had different definitions for it but it was not covering all aspects of DevOps.

## Here’s why its a combination of culture, process and tools:

**Culture**: Mindset of people in the organization largely matters. For example, some people in the organization could be afraid of change and could continue doing Ops the old fashioned way (Developers develop, operations operate). It introduces “silos” between development and operations team which is not healthy for an organization. This was one of the main reasons why the term “DevOps” was born.

**Process**: We need to agree upon set of processes with various stakeholders in the organization in-order to deliver continuously without compromising on reliability of the application. Few of the DevOps processes would be Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment, Proactive monitoring etc…

**Tools**: Tools help us to automate the right set of processes and also tasks which where done manually historically. This could increase velocity of the team.

To conclude, developers and operations have the same goal: to make the organization as productive as possible. DevOps brings both teams together to work towards that common goal.
